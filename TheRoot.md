# The Root
For this challenge, launch a terminal, invoke the pwn program using its absolute path to capture the flag

## The Solve
I will launch a program by specifying its path in the command line. In this instance, I will provide the complete path, beginning from /, so the path will be /pwn. This type of path, which starts from the root directory, is known as an "absolute path."

code:
```
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sChKj3fPT6HG2ZzbNXQ2yHGDh3R.QX4cTO0wiMwEzNzEzW}
```
flag: `pwn.college{sChKj3fPT6HG2ZzbNXQ2yHGDh3R.QX4cTO0wiMwEzNzEzW}`
