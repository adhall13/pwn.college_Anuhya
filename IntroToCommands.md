# INTRO TO COMMANDS
For this challenge, we must invoke the hello command to get the flag

# The Solve
Here, I executed the command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again will display the prompt, ready for the next command. In this level, I invoked the hello command to get the flag.

flag: pwn.college{gZsLiKKwezyOlrMwavgNQNgx0dw.QX3YjM1wiMwEzNzEzW}
