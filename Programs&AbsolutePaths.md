# PROGRAMS AND ABSOLUTE PATHS
For this challenge, we must execute it by invoking its absolute path

## The Solve
In this task, the location of the challenge directory is /challenge. The challenge program for this level is called run and is located in the /challenge directory. Therefore, the full path to the run challenge program is /challenge/run. We can execute it by using its absolute path, after which I will obtain the flag.

code:
```
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4ehI2Lik4C_YFqovRQU1y6WMT5i.QX1QTN0wiMwEzNzEzW}
```

flag: `pwn.college{4ehI2Lik4C_YFqovRQU1y6WMT5i.QX1QTN0wiMwEzNzEzW} `
