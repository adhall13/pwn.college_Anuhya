# Command History
For this challenge, we must grab the flag injected in history.

## The Solve
Using the up and down arrow keys, I navigated through the saved commands. For this task, I obtained the flag that had been added to my history by opening a terminal, using the up arrow key, and extracting the flag.

code:
```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{UA0fqGDntxXkaYZARtxdCvHsU9i.0lNzEzNxwiMwEzNzEzW}
```
flag: `pwn.college{UA0fqGDntxXkaYZARtxdCvHsU9i.0lNzEzNxwiMwEzNzEzW}`
